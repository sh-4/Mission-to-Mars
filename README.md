# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide web scraping for articles and facts about Mars, complete with a featured image and all four hemispheres. The information has all been gathered for viewing on one simple webpage, which is also mobile-responsive.

## Summary

When running the app.py file, and clicking the "Scrape New Data" button on the web page, the user will be able to access the latest Mars data. The webpage has been stylized to a 'dark mode' to be more gentle on the viewer's eyes.
